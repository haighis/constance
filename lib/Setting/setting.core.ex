# Functional Core
# A Setting libary that is developed as a functional core. 
# The functional core is library implementation.
# The functional core should work on data thatâ€™s validated and safe. It should be predictable, so it avoids side effects.
# A functional core is means to easily reason about the application core business logic that is the same pattern 
# created by James Edward Gray and Bruce A. Tate found in the book "Designing Elixir Systems with OTP". 
# 
# Design
# The Setting uses 
# - Etso Ecto Adapter Repository pattern
# Usage
# Setting.Core.get_all      
# SqliteSetting.Repo.all(SqliteSetting.Model)   
# Setting.Core.save("mykey","myvalue")      
# Setting.Core.update(1,"mykey","mynewvalue")
# Setting.Core.delete_by_id(1) 
# Setting.Core.get_by_id(1)

    # Handle Put - Updates (or Inserts the value if it does not exist in the cache)
